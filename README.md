**Mobile Mail Layout Design**

It is a mini-project that designs a mailbox app using the cross-platform framework called Flutter. Future development will create a back-end to send and receive mail content to the front-end. The purpose of this project is for someone who wants to keep the mail system standalone and fully control the restricted data. Furthermore, this side-project can be part of another system, like a mailbox for E-Shopping or a public mail page that can send emails to the author.

The following tasks in a Flutter project:

UI:
- create a mailbox interface like Gmail, Outlook
- drawer with an expandable menu
- Floating Action Button with multiple buttons
